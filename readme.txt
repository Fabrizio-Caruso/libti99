This library is released by Tursi aka Mike Brent for TI-99/4A coding via GCC. It is released to the public domain with no restrictions (but credit would be nice if you use it). Likewise, I make no guarantees or promises!

Documentation is found in each of the .h files. The .h files are briefly described here:

grom.h	-	helper definitions and functions for accessing GROM
halt.h	-	include file for the halt() call
kscan.h	-	include file for using the console's kscan code (including joysticks)
player.h-	include file for using my compressed VGM audio player
sound.h	-	helper definitions for the sound chip and console sound interrupt player
vdp.h	-	helper definitions and functions for the VDP and console interrupt
